Easily embed http://meegloo.com streams into your blog

== Description ==

Meegloo lets you use your phone to share text, audio, video and photos about the topics you care about, and easily share them with your friends and followers.

Whether youâ€™re at a small meetup or a large conference, you can post audio and video clips, photos and text updates to your followers, through one simple app. You can also do this online at
[meegloo.com](http://meegloo.com).

This plugin lets you easily embed your streams into a WordPress blog post or page, by simply putting the address of your stream on a single line, like you would a YouTube video.

== Installation ==

It's really simple to get going. You can download the plugin from the WordPress directory or install it directly from the WordPress admin dashboard.

To install the plugin from the wordpress.org plugin directory:

1. Download `meegloo.zip`,
2. Unzip it and upload the `meegloo` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress,

== How to embed a stream ==

Simply type the contents of your post or page as normal, then

1. Visit `http://<your-username>meegloo.com` and find the stream you want to embed.
2. Copy the URL of the stream and paste it on a new line into your blog post or page.

Once you publish or preview your post, you'll see the contents of your stream appear exactly where you placed the URL. The formatting of the content matches your site's formatting exactly. And just as in meegloo.com, your stream will automatically update as new content is added.
